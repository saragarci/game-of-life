# Game Of Life

This application is a representation of the Game Of Life.

**About the game**

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

**Rules**

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

## Usage

### Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  * Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source.
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

### Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./GameOfLife`.

### Starting the game

After running `./GameOfLife` the user needs to create an initial pattern in order to see how it evolves. For this, follow the next steps:
1. On the window that will open up, choose the cells you want to activate by clicking on them using your mouse. The cells that you activate will end up being the initial pattern. In the [Examples of patterns section from the Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns) you can find examples of initial patterns that you may want to try.
2. Once you are done, press enter to start the game and see how the pattern evolves with each iteration.
3. To stop the game, simply close the window.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into four main classes:
* **Grid**: Represents the grid of the game and is therefore a container of all the cells. In this class the SDL window and render are created. It also contains very important methods like: `createCells()`, which creates the initial matrix of cells and a copy of it; `drawCells()`, which rerenders every cell again; and last but not least `updateCells()`, which is the method that applies the rules of the game of life and updates the state of each cell accordingly.
* **Cell**: Represents a cell, which is the most basic unit in this project. A cell is defined by a boolean `isAlive` and an `SDL_Rect` (which contains the underlying rectangle that this cell has).
* **Controller**: This class is used to retrieve the user input. Here, events like a mouse click, pressing enter or quit are tracked.
* **Game**: The game class is the class that puts all of this together. It has two main methods: its constructor, where the game is initialized with the user inserting the initial pattern; and the `startGame()` method, which contains an infinite loop that will keep doing iterations on the present grid and updating it.
